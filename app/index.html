              <p>
                Truth is stranger than fiction, at least for those blessed with interesting lives. The rest of us have no choice but to live vicariously through their stories. In the case of bestselling cult author Chuck Palahniuk, the embellishment of his exploits by fans has made it hard to tell exactly where reality ends and the storytelling begins. There are those who would have us believe he entered this world kicking and screaming, brandishing a pen, when in fact he comes from much more humble (albeit interesting) beginnings.

                <p>Born February 21, 1962, Charles Michael Palahniuk spent his early childhood living out of a mobile home in Burbank, Washington. His parents, Carol and Fred Palahniuk, separated and divorced when he was fourteen, leaving Chuck and his siblings to spend much of their time on their maternal grandparent’s cattle ranch.</p>
              </li>
              <li data-in-effect="fadeIn" data-out-effect="fadeOut">
                <p>Palahniuk attended journalism school at the University of Oregon, receiving his degree in 1986. After college, Palahniuk reported for a radio station in Eugene, Oregon, then started to write for Portland's Oregonian newspaper. He soon
                  switched gears entirely, going to work as a diesel mechanic, a job he would hold until his career as a fiction writer took off.</p>

            <li data-in-effect="fadeIn" data-out-effect="fadeOut">
          <p>Palahniuk's books prior to Lullaby have distinct similarities. The characters are people who have been marginalized in one way or another by society, and often react with self-destructive aggressiveness. He labels these stories as transgressional fiction. Beginning with Lullaby, the style of his novels changed to mostly satirical horror stories.</p>
          </li>
          <li data-in-effect="fadeIn" data-out-effect="fadeOut">
          <p>The narratives of Palahniuk's books often are structured in medias res, starting at the temporal end, with the protagonist recounting the events that led up to the point at which the book begins. Lullaby used a variation of this, alternating between the normal, linear narrative and the temporal end, after every few chapters. Exceptions to this narrative form, however, include the more linear Choke and Diary.</p>

          <p>When he attempted to publish his novel, Invisible Monsters, publishers rejected it. This led him to work on his most famous novel, Fight Club, which he wrote as an attempt to disturb the publisher even more for rejecting him.</p>
          <p>Directed by David Fincher, the adaptation of Fight Club was a flop at the box office, but achieved cult status on DVD. The year of its release, the film was Fox’s top selling disc, and critics everywhere finally began to embrace it. The film’s popularity drove sales of the novel, resulting in multiple re-printings over the next few years.</p>
